# GitHub User Guide for MCTs

Cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, are updated frequently. This leads to issues for Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCTs) when they teach courses, such as *20532: Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions*, *20533: Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions*, or *20535: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions* because lab steps change frequently as the service changes. Due to the frequency of the changes and the fact that there may not be any notification when changes occur, it can be difficult for the course development team to rapidly identify and address any lab changes.

To address these issues, we are using GitHub to publish the lab steps and lab scripts for courses that cover cloud services like Azure. Using GitHub allows for collaboration between the course’s authors and MCTs to keep the content current with Azure platform changes. Using GitHub allows the MCTs to provide feedback and suggestions for lab changes, and then the course authors can update lab steps and scripts quickly and relatively easily.

When you prepare to teach these courses, you should ensure that you are using the latest lab steps and scripts by downloading the appropriate files from GitHub.

This user guide is for MCTs who are new to GitHub, and it provides steps for connecting to GitHub, downloading and printing course materials, updating the scripts that students use in labs, and explaining how you can help ensure that this course’s content remains current.

**Note:** It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students. Pointing students directly to GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are receiving separate Lab instructions can highlight the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.

## GitHub terminology

GitHub introduces terminology that might be new to you, and the following list includes terms and concepts that this document uses. However, for a full list of GitHub terms, refer to the “GitHub Glossary” at <https://help.github.com/articles/GitHub-glossary/>.

  *Git* and *GitHub*: *Git* is an open-source, change-tracking program, and *GitHub* is a site/solution built on Git. There are other websites and solutions that use Git as their backend. You would use GitHub primarily for open-source (public) development projects, and it is free for those projects. However, if you want to use GitHub for projects that are private, and not open source, you must sign up for a paid version.

  *Repo* or *Repository*: Each project in GitHub is in a repository, or *repo*. A repo contains all of a project’s files, including documentation, and it supports revision history. A repository can be public or private, and you can have a local copy of the repo on your computer hard drive, or you can use the repo within GitHub.

  *Markdown*: This is a text-file format that you can use for creating documentation. It is text-based and very simple to update, which makes it easy to use during collaboration. GitHub then renders it as HTML.

  *GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)*: There are many variations, or flavors, of the Markdown file format. The GitHub version, commonly referred to as *GFM*, is one of the most common variations of Markdown. For more information about GFM and how you can use the Markup format for your GFM documents, refer to “Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub” at https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/.

  *Fork*: This is a copy of another repo that resides in your GitHub account, in comparison to a *branch*, which lives in the original repo. See “Branch” directly below.

  *Branch*: This is a copy of a repository that resides in the same repository as the original. You can merge a branch with the original.

  *Fetch*: This is the process of retrieving a copy of the latest changes from an online repo. However, a fetch *does not* merge changes.

  *Pull*: This is the process of fetching the latest changes from an online repo and merging them with local changes.

  *Merge*: This is the process of fetching changes from one branch and applying them to another. This includes retrieving changes from an online repo, and then applying them to that repo’s local version.

  *Pull request*: This is a set of proposed changes to a repo that a user submit, and a repo’s owners or collaborators then can accept or reject the pull request.

  *Push*: This is the process of sending or submitting your local changes to the online repo.

  *Collaborator*: This is a GitHub user that has permissions to add, delete, or change a repo’s content.

## Overview of Microsoft Learning's GitHub solution for course labs

The Microsoft Learning team has created a solution that allows them to publish updated lab and lab answer keys (LAKs) and updated lab scripts regularly to GitHub. The solution also includes a script and tools that you can use to print labs and lab answer keys from Microsoft Word .docx files. It is highly recommended that you use the provided Word .docx files instead of building them manually.

### Downloading the latest materials for course labs

The latest lab instructions and AllFiles compressed folder are always available at the following link: <https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20535-ArchitectingMicrosoftAzureSolutions/releases/latest>

## Receiving update notifications, suggesting changes, and collaborating on projects

You can configure your GitHub experience so that you receive notifications when updates occur to a GitHub repo. There are several ways in which you can sign up for notifications, and many of them relate to the many ways that you can collaborate on a project. To receive notifications, you can:

*Watch repositories*: When you watch a repository, GitHub subscribes you automatically to notifications for any new pull requests or issues that are created for that specific repository. You automatically watch any repository that you create or for which you are a collaborator.

*Pull request*: When you create a pull request, and propose that the owners of a repo accept a change that you make, you automatically subscribe to receive notifications for the related discussion about the pull request. In order to create a Pull request you must first create a branch.

*Comments*: When you make comments about another person’s pull request, GitHub subscribes you automatically to the forum that pertains to that comment, or you can subscribe to the forum manually.

*Issues*: An issue is a suggestion, question, or request that pertains to a repository. Each issue has its own discussion, and you can subscribe to issues, or GitHub subscribes you automatically to issues that you create.

*Mentions*: When another user mentions you in a conversation, using your GitHub user name (@*username*), GitHub subscribes you automatically to the discussion.

You can modify how and when you receive notifications, and you also can unsubscribe to any or all discussions.

### Watching a repo

The simplest way to make sure you know about any changes to a repo is to **watch** it. You can do that, even if you do not clone a local copy of the repo.

To watch a repo, perform the following steps:

1.  <span id="to-watch-a-repository" class="anchor"></span>In Internet Explorer, navigate to the repo on GitHub.

2.  Click **Watch**, and then under **Notifications**, select **Watching**.

To quit watching a repo, perform the following steps:

1.  <span id="to-unwatch-a-repository" class="anchor"></span>In Internet Explorer, navigate to the repo on GitHub.

2.  Click **Watch**, and then under Notifications, select **Not watching**.

> **Note:** You can select the **Ignoring** option under the **Watch** drop-down list. However, this means that you receive *no* notifications, even if another user includes you in a discussion with the mention functionality and your GitHub user name. Therefore, you should be careful configuring the **Ignoring** option.

### Suggesting changes and collaborating on a repo

GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with other Microsoft Learning users on the courses in which you are interested.

You can modify your own copy of the lab materials, and then submit your changes to Microsoft Learning so that they can incorporate your updates. You might want to modify your lab materials if:

You find a mistake in a lab.

The UI has changed since the lab was created.

You think that the lab needs improvements or modifications.

To modify lab materials, you should branch the repo, make updates in your branch, and then submit a pull request to the main (master) branch. This allows Microsoft Learning staff, and other MCTs and GitHub users to review, and comment on, your changes.

You can review and comment on changes that other users make, and Microsoft Learning staff then approves and merges these changes into the master branch. This action notifies any user who is watching the repo that a change has occurred.
